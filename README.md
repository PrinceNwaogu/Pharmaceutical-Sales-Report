## Key Insights
1. Pharmacy recorded 54 million in sales (with 15M units sold), slightly outperforming Hospitals which had 51 million in sales (with 14M units sold).
2. 2018 sales showed a declining trend throughout the year, with the lowest sales recorded in December (€215M).
3. Brittany Bold led with €3.64bn in sales, followed by Alisha Cordwell (€2.82bn), Tracy Banks (€2.76bn), and James Goodwill (€2.58bn). The sales performance is well-distributed among the top managers, but Brittany Bold appears to be the strongest performer over time.
4. 2020 sales showed a positive trend within the first quarter, March had the highest sales (523K units), January had the lowest sales (430K units). This suggests an increase in demand as the quarter progressed.


## Recommendations
1. Address the Declining Monthly Sales Trend:
   * Since sales declined after March, seasonality analysis should be conducted to understand why.
   * Introduce promotional campaigns or discounts in lower sales months to boost demand.
   * Adjust inventory and supply chain strategies to prepare for high-demand months (March and June).
2. Leverage High-Performing Sales Managers:
   * Brittany Bold and Tracy Banks should be utilized for training and mentoring other sales managers.
   * Analyze their strategies to replicate successful sales techniques across the team.
3. Leverage Sales Trends for Strategic Planning:
   * Sales increase in the first quarter of 2020 suggests a rising demand pattern, which should be capitalized on.
   * The decline in December and October could indicate a seasonal dip; promotions or marketing efforts should be introduced during these months to sustain sales.
4. Enhance Sales Strategies for Low-Performing Months:
   * Since October 2019 and January 2020 had the lowest sales, businesses should introduce targeted campaigns or discount strategies during these months to maintain revenue flow.
  

## Conclusion
This dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for tracking pharmaceutical sales performance, identifying key trends, and improving business strategies. By leveraging interactive visualizations, stakeholders can make informed decisions to drive growth and efficiency in the pharmaceutical sector.
